# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Crypto Project -----------------------------------------

Crypto Details Page: Displays detailed information about a specific cryptocurrency, including market cap, price changes, and a price history chart.

Price Comparison: Users can compare real-time prices of different cryptocurrencies from various markets.

WebSocket Integration: Real-time price updates via WebSockets.

Price History Chart: A chart that displays historical prices of the selected cryptocurrency.

Available Routes:

1. Description: The home page that displays a list of cryptocurrencies with their current prices and market data.
Data Fetched: Market data (price, market cap, price change percentage).

2. /crypto/:id
Description: The detailed page for a specific cryptocurrency, accessed by clicking on a card from the homepage.
Data Fetched: Cryptocurrency details (name, market data), historical price data, tickers (for price comparison across different markets).

3. Network Error if 429 error from the server.

### API Integration

The app uses the following CoinGecko API endpoints:

Market Data:
/simple/price: To get current price information for a list of cryptocurrencies.
/coins/markets: To get the market data for cryptocurrencies like price, market cap, etc.
Coin Details:
/coins/{id}: To get detailed information about a specific cryptocurrency.
/coins/{id}/tickers: To fetch the available tickers for a specific cryptocurrency.
/coins/{id}/history: To fetch the historical data of a cryptocurrency.

### Technologies Used
React.js
Redux Toolkit
Axios (for API calls)
Chart.js (for price history charts)
